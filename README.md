# Computational Model for Inspecting TensorFlow CPU/GPU Installations
> This Python script checks the TensorFlow (TF) installation & inspects its functionality on available CPU/GPU devices via basic mathematical operations. Such operations are represented with a TF *dataflow graph*. Then, graph parts are run by TF *session* across a set of available CPU/GPU devices.

## Instructions
Run the *main.py* script with the following command (with an activated TensorFlow environment).
```
python main.py
```

## Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* TensorFlow 1.6+
